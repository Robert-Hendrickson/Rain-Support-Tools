                        <div>Messaging on this From number is forbidden most commonly because the number does not belong to BW or the account. Other reasons include: the TN is not enabled in the Bandwidth Dashboard, the account associated with this number is not enabled for this type of messaging, the TN is disconnected, or it is an invalid number (i.e., 11111111111).</div>

                        <div>Messaging to this To number is forbidden. This could be that the destination number is not active, not enabled for messaging, or is an invalid number (i.e. 11111111111). It may also mean one or more of the recipients in a group message is not valid(i.e. one of the recipients is a TFN orSC).</div>
